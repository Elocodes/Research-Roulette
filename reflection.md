## A Reflection on AI-Assisted Development
This project, a simple "Research-Roulette" game became an unexpected case study in the promises and pitfalls of AI-assisted development. What began as a straightforward task quickly devolved into a frustrating loop of debugging, teaching me profound lessons about prompting, project configuration, and the inherent limitations of a conversational AI partner.

The core of my initial plan was to use a modern, complex stack—Next.js with Tailwind CSS—and have the AI handle the intricacies of setting up the build process. Initially, this worked beautifully. The AI swiftly generated a script to populate the game with data and scaffolding for a React component. This demonstrated a clear and immediate benefit: automating tedious and time-consuming tasks. The ability to generate a structured JSON file with credible, verifiable data sources would have taken me hours to do by hand.

However, a fundamental disconnect emerged almost immediately. The AI seemed to lack a true understanding of my specific development environment. It confidently generated code that was not compatible with my project's module system, leading to a silent failure where no styles were being applied. I entered a frustrating cycle of "going in circles," where the AI would propose the same fixes—reinstalling packages, updating configuration files—without addressing the root cause. This felt incredibly limiting. The AI was a powerful tool, but it was blind to the environmental factors that were causing the errors. It lacked the ability to step back and diagnose a broader, systemic issue.

I learned that AI Collaboration requires an active and skeptical human partner. The breakthrough only came when I took control of the debugging process and proposed an experimental change: "messing up" few lines in the code to see what would happen. This forced the AI to re-evaluate its assumptions and provided the crucial clue that the build system was working, but the Tailwind configuration was not. Ultimately, After days of battling a misconfigured Next.js and Tailwind setup, I have learned that AI is a fantastic collaborator for content and logic generation, but for complex, opaque configuration problems, a human's ability to simplify and pivot remains an indispensable skill.
